/**
 * One of the first stages of the robot. This is the initial localization to
 * find out which corner the robot is in. This routine makes use of the walls at
 * the corners to find its absolute theta. Once the theta is known then finding
 * which corner the robot is situated in is easy (i.e. If the walls are at 0 and
 * 90 degrees then you're in the top left corner)
